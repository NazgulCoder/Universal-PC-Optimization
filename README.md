## Why I decided to create this
<details>
  <summary>Little story of troubleshooting issues with my PC</summary>
<br>
Thank you for taking the time to read my story.
  <br><br>
I'll start by describing my PC's behavior. For several days, I had been experiencing severe frame drops and stuttering while gaming. That's why I decided to "debug" my hardware and software to discover the cause of these issues and, ultimately, fix them. I'm glad to say that, by the end of my journey, during which I learned about many topics I was previously unaware of, I managed to fully resolve all my problems. Now, I'm enjoying stable frame rates while gaming, along with consistent CPU usage, temperature, energy consumption, and performance.

The guide below is a kind of story about all the steps I took to debug and identify the root cause of my issue.

I'll divide the guide into multiple chapters to improve readability and split it into 2 Macro topics: Software and Hardware

  - [Optimize Windows](#optimize-windows)
  - [Steps](#steps)

# Software
## Optimize Windows
It might sound odd, but many people believe Windows is the perfect environment where everything should be working flawlessly. Hard pill to swallow: NO!

Windows comes with a lot of junk installed by default. Plus, many manufacturers add their junk stuff. Luckily there are many tools out there to de-bloat your system and improve performance.

One of my favourite software to do that it's [Optimizer](https://github.com/hellzerg/optimizer)

My recommendation is to turn on the <ins>**Optimize Performance**</ins> option, enable <ins>**Gaming Mode**</ins>. If it is not necessary or requested by your games or apps, I highly recommend you to turn off the <ins>**Xbox Live**</ins> and <ins>**Game Bar**</ins>.
